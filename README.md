# Classical-Simulation

Experimental queue:

    Global and local interactions - Both short and long range forces should be implemented in each particle container.
    Train a net for each amino acid for the purpose of folding. Parse training data from RCSB Protein Data Bank.
    Dynamic boundaries - expand and contract its boundary in 3 dimensions. Smaller, resizing pistons may be placed inside each other.
    Colocalizing boundaries - A dynamic "cell" of interaction follows each particle.
